                    <p>In a team of 12, I helped developed the map "Cursed Cove" for Valve Software's "Team Fortress 2".
                        The map was bought and featured by Valve as a part of the Halloween "Scream Fortress" event in
                        2018. On the team, I contributed concepts for the level design, and I developed parts of the
                        background/skybox of the map. In the map, players must kill other players to collect their
                        souls, and then must deliver those souls to Davy Jones' Locker.</p>

                    <h3>Design Concepts</h3>
                    <p>During pre-production of the map, I contributed ideas for
                        possible building shapes, locations on the map, and gameplay concepts. In order to create the
                        feeling of a &quot;bustling pirate bay&quot; our buildings were made very tall with lots of
                        cramped, narrow alleyways in between.</p>

                    <h3>Background and Skybox Detailing</h3>
                    <p>When the playable area of the map was nearly complete, some teammates and I started working on
                        the out-of-bounds areas. While the playable area was symmetrical between the two teams, RED and
                        BLU, the out-of-bounds areas would be asymmetrical to appear more visually interesting. I helped
                        develop the jungle/forest area behind RED's base, as well as the cobble fortress behind BLU's
                        base. This perfectly blended Team Fortress 2's tropes of RED using lots of natural, wooden
                        materials, and BLU
                        using lots of industrial materials for their bases with an old-timey pirate theme. While much of
                        BLU's fortress was scrapped in the final product due to optimization concerns, it still helped
                        us understand the visual style were we aiming for.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Academic/Personal, February - May 2020</h3>
                    <p>Scarlet Meadow is a 2D platformer, beat-em-up game with traditional, hand-drawn animation,
                        developed in C# and Monogame. I worked with a team as the lead artist, but I also developed the
                        physics system for objects in the game, enemy behavior, UI elements, and I designed and
                        developed a
                        robust, graphical level editor using for content production for the game. The game features
                        traditional, hand-drawn animation with inspiration from comic books and Cuban architecture.</p>

                    <h3>Physics and Interactivity</h3>
                    <p>Many of the elements of Scarlet Meadow are physically interactive, meaning that a robust physics
                        system that also responded well to the player's
                        inputs was needed. I developed a physics system that has velocity, air resistance, and collision
                        detection
                        using axis-aligned bounding boxes. The collisions could be customized to be solid, semi-solid
                        (meaning a platform the player can jump through), or triggers for certain events. In terms of
                        interactive elements, I developed ziplines, trampolines, Scarlet's lasso attack which shoots out
                        a lasso that grabs onto anything it touches and then comes straight back to the player, enemy
                        behavior,
                        linear and bouncy projectiles, collectible items, stage objectives, and much more.

                    <h3>The Scarlet Editor and Level Design Pipeline</h3>
                    <p>&quot;Scarlet Meadow&quot; features 16 unique levels all designed by me. Each level only takes
                        about 2-3 minutes to complete, but they are tough, meaning that new players will be retrying
                        each one until they master them all. In order to build all 16 levels, a powerful level editor
                        tool was needed. Inspired by Valve Software’s &quot;Hammer Editor&quot; and Super Mario Maker’s
                        &quot;Course Editor&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Editor&quot; gives the user full control of their
                        levels, letting them paint tiles of collision data, place props, enemies, items, and change
                        properties of the level such as the background or level objective. The editor also has some
                        quality of life features, such as being able to zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, pan
                        around by clicking and dragging, and more. Stages are stored in &quot;.scar&quot; (Scarlet)
                        files,
                        which, when directly loaded into the game, will optimize the collision mesh and let the user
                        play their level. I developed all of these systems in about 3 weeks.</p>

                    <h3>Traditional, Hand-Drawn Animation with Comic Book Flare</h3>
                    <p>I conceptualized and originally designed the Scarlet Meadow character back in 2017, but as my own
                        art style has changed and improved since then, so has the design of the character. For use in
                        this full game, I fleshed out the overall world by adding more characters, such as Scarlet's
                        friend Cocoa Cavero, the cactus civilians, and enemies like the Lawmakers and Robberbarons. All
                        of the characters for this game are hand-drawn and inked on physical paper, and then scanned in
                        to be colored
                        digitally. This method gives the animation its hand-drawn charm, but the actual style, inpired
                        by pop art, street art, and comic books, is angular, colorful, and bold. As with my previous
                        project, &quot;Neon Pong&quot;, I applied a halftone filter to everything, which was a quick and
                        affordable way to give some much needed texture and comic book flare to the otherwise flat
                        graphics.</p>

                    <h3>&quot;Curbana&quot; and Environmental Design</h3>
                    <p>The game takes place in &quot;Curbana&quot;, a fictional urban environment of skyscrapers mixed
                        with
                        colorful, Cuban inspired architecture. The props scattered throughout the levels are designed to
                        give the
                        levels a bit of depth in a 2D setting, while also making sure that characters, items, and
                        interactive objects all share a bold, black outline that pops out to players' eyes.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Personal, February - April 2018</h3>
                    <p>A Team Fortress 2 map that makes players fight against my own 1930's style animated characters,
                        play minigames for power-ups, and take control of the center control point, all released on
                        April Fools as a
                        &quot;joke styled map&quot;. I was
                        inspired by Studio MDHR's 2017 game, &quot;Cuphead&quot;, with its own 1930's aesthetics and
                        jazz
                        soundtrack. This was the first time I had done a large scale project based on hand-drawn
                        animation. This project was done solo.</p>

                    <p><img src="media/queen-banner.png" alt="Queen Elizabeth logo and character" class="queen-banner">
                    </p>

                    <h3>A New, Old-Timey, Concept</h3>
                    <p> No one had really done a map with hand-drawn animated
                        characters before, at least not to the same scope that I was going to attempt, meaning I was on
                        my own to figure out how it should work. With hard limits on how much I could push the Source
                        Engine to my will, I brainstormed many ideas
                        on how to accomplish my goal. I thought of using 3D models with animated textures, but that was
                        beyond my skillset at the time. I also thought of having tons of brushes, each one with
                        a single frame of animation textured on it, that would flicker on and off in a sequence, but
                        that would be wildly inefficient. I finally decided to utilize particle systems, as they are
                        literally meant for putting 2D sprites in a 3D environment, and they gave me a huge range of
                        customizability.
                    </p>

                    <p>The first test had some flickering issues, so to fix
                        this I just duplicated the animation. Overall, using the particle system was a very cheap and
                        easy way to display the animations in the map, and it also meant I could make the character
                        always face the player's viewpoint, making the character look very evil.</p>

                    </video>

                    <p>After that first in-game test, I saw the potential of the idea, and I knew I had something
                        special.</p>
                    <h3>The Hand-Drawn Process</h3>
                    <p>The design of the queen is based on many actual queens in history, such as <a
                            href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/404444/elizabeth-i-when-a-princess"
                            target="_blank">William Scrotts' painting of Elizabeth I</a>, a
                        <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Young_Queen_Victoria.jpg"
                            target="_blank">young Queen Victoria</a>, and
                        <a href="https://www.purecostumes.com/FM58372/queen-elizabeth-adult-costume.html"
                            target="_blank">various Halloween costumes of queens</a> I found on Google. I was a
                        big fan of the warm tones used in the clothing, and decided to give her a red and gold color
                        palette. Her actual visual design is loosely based off of how I would think Americans in the
                        1930's would picture an evil English queen, but modernized a bit to fit today's standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to properly animate the queen, I bought a cheap light pad, some tracing paper, and I got
                        to work. My process was to pencil draw each frame (&quot;pencil test&quot;), scan frames to
                        digital images with a
                        printer/scanner, intsert the images into a video, look for issues in the animation make any
                        adjustments needed, repeat until the
                        movement was where I wanted it. I then trace over each frame on another sheet with .3 mm and
                        .1mm PITT Artist Pens (&quot;inking&quot;), scan each frame again, and then color digitally
                        with Paint.NET.</p>

                    <p>In total, the animation clocked in at about 80-90 frames, with there being about 160 drawings, as
                        each frame had both a pencil and inked version. It was a long process that took about a month,
                        but
                        the final result was such a
                        good imitation of the 1930's style. Many people who played the map did not realize that it was
                        original animation with an original character. Some even thought that I ripped the
                        animation straight from &quot;Cuphead&quot;, which in my opinion means I did a pretty good job.
                    </p>

                    <h3>That's Not All, Folks</h3>
                    <p>As a map developed for an April Fools celebration, it has plenty more to offer than just the boss
                        fight. The map is filled to the brim with minigames, jokes, references, and all sorts of fun
                        little
                        knick knacks. While the boss fight was the main focus, these smaller
                        moments are what support the map, and they made sure the in game voice chat was filled with
                        bursts of laughter.

                    <p>A look at just some of the map logic/entities used for the queen boss fight and minigames. I
                        really tried to
                        stay organized by categorizing things into columns.</p>
                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>On April 10th, 2018 I woke up to a surprise message from popular
                        YouTuber, <a href="https://twitter.com/RTGameCrowd" target="_blank">RTGame Daniel</a>, saying he
                        was releasing a video about my map. Since then, RTGame Daniel has amassed an enormous following
                        on YouTube and Twitch, and the small success of my map has
                        encouraged me to keep going until I stumble upon my next great idea. I am very appreciative of
                        RTGame, his community, and the opportunities they opened up for me. You can watch his video,
                        which shows the map in good detail, below.

                    <p>Queen Elizabeth III was the first time I had done a large scale project based on hand-drawn
                        animation, and those techniques and skills can be seen influencing my future projects
                        such as Neon Pong and Scarlet Meadow.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Academic/Personal, April - May 2019</h3>
                    <p>A side-scrolling, singleplayer game where you return attacks from a "Pong" based enemy in urban
                        environments. I developed the game with a partner using Java and its built-in libraries.
                        The game features traditional, hand-drawn animation and a bold comic book style made by me. Neon
                        Pong had a very quick development cycle and some technical hurdles, which affected all aspects
                        of the project.

                    <h3>A Dynamic Take on an Old Classic</h3>
                    <p>In Neon Pong, your goal is to win a Pong game, but this time you control a physical character
                        rather than a simple bar/paddle. Everytime you hit the ball, its speed increases and you built
                        up a special meter. The game required physics, precise movement, and fast graphics.
                        My partner and I started by developing a simple update-render cycle that
                        took advantage of multiple threads to display graphics. The game needed to run at a frame rate
                        of at least 30-60 frames per second, and it needed to do this on the school computers. Due to
                        this, the game's resolution is locked at 720p, and it limits how many images we can render at
                        once.
                    </p>

                    <p>I then developed the physics and collisions systems, which were not as optimized as they could
                        have been,
                        as the collisions used a lot of &quot;pixel perfect&quot; calculations for basic rectangle
                        hitboxes. Of course, after the fact we realize we should have used the more efficient
                        Axis-Aligned Bounding Box collisions, which I do use in later projects. I also developed an
                        external &quot;Animation
                        Viewer&quot; tool in Java that lets me add images to an animation as frames, customize their
                        order, and dynamically adjust the speed of the animations. This let me quickly scan pencil tests
                        and immediately load them into the tool to find and
                        fix any janky movement. It also allowed me to fine-tune the speed of the animation so they could
                        go directly into the game.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-Drawn Animation with Comic Book Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>With this games very quick development cycle, I had to cut some corners on the animation. The
                        longest hand-drawn animations were the run
                        cycles, clocking in at only 6 frames each (not including the electric-shock effect, which is 20
                        frames but was done digitally). All other animations were just 1 frame poses. This made all
                        of the movement feel very snappy, but that actually meshed really well with the fast, precise
                        gameplay. I also applied a
                        halftone filter to everything, which was a really cheap and effective method to add some much
                        needed texture to otherwise flat drawings, and it made everything look like it came straight
                        from a comic book.
                    </p>

                    </div>


                    <h3>Detailed Backgrounds in a 2D Scene</h3>
                    <p>While the animation was hand-drawn, I did not have time to draw or paint backgrounds, so I made
                        them by creating maps in Team Fortress 2. These were dioramas of sorts that were only seen from
                        one angle, and they were originally split up into layers for a parallax scrolling effect, but
                        this got cut due to optimization concerns. Using TF2 as a base let me quickly add lighting and
                        use premade assets, which gave the background detail in a very short timespan. I also
                        applied halftone filters here so they were mesh well with the animation.

                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>Compared to my other projects, Neon Pong is definitely smaller content wise. But being one of the
                        first games that I built entirely from scratch, having such a small development cycle, and being
                        one of the last major projects I did during my senior year of high school, it holds a special
                        place in my heart. Our teacher gave us an immediate 100&#37; on the graphics, but docked us a
                        couple
                        points on the game, as it was a little too fast and difficult for her. The characters of Neon
                        Pong, Electra and Suit, will return as part of a much larger ensemble of characters in Neon
                        Heights.</p>

                    <p>A local and online multiplayer game currently being developed in Unity. Two teams of four players
                        pick between eight different unique characters to play in this intense Team Hand Ball inspired

                        prototypes, I have programmed menus and UI, local multiplayer, and game logic, and I have
                        designed characters and environments for the project.</p>

                <div class="modal-desc">
                    <h3>The Spark</h3>
                    <p>Concepts for Neon Heights date back to November 2018, when I first designed the
                        &quot;Electra&quot; character, which sparked the whole idea. Two teams try to get a ball in the
                        other
                        team's goal and intense back-and-forth gameplay ensues with movement systems that can be comboed
                        together. Each character has a unique &quot;fluorescent ability&quot; that charges up based on
                        passes made to teammates. These abilities can range from building defensive walls to flipping
                        the gravity of the stage.
                    </p>

                    <p>Besides the gameplay, I really want to focus on the characterization of the game. I want to
                        design eight very special characters, rather than a hundred unmemorable ones. The game takes
                        place in a variety of urban environments such as neon-lit rooftops and overgrown underpasses,
                        but its all set in one city that reeks of inequality. The name &quot;Neon Heights&quot; is a pun
                        off of &quot;neon lights&quot;, but the &quot;Heights&quot; refers to not only the large
                        skyscrapers of the city, but also the social differences between people in the city, like a
                        social/financial hierarchy or totem pole. The teams are based around
                        &quot;Champions VS Underdogs&quot;, and while there are no gameplay differences between the
                        teams, visually they will appear different, with the Champions repping a bright white, almost
                        golden color scheme, and the Underdogs repping a darker, but more colorful color scheme.

                    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
                    <p>I started developing prototypes on and off in my free time in Feburary 2019, and after a couple
                        play tests with my friends at the end of 2019, it proves to be a fun concept that just needs
                        some ironing out. In June 2020, my friend and I started working on an online multiplayer version
                        using Mirror Networking, an open source networking system for Unity.
