                    <h2>Level Design & Environment Art</h2>
                    <p>I started doing level design as a hobby in 2014 with Team Fortress 2. Since then, I have expanded
                        my skills in designing playable spaces through personal and professional work, and I have
                        started creating unique and modular models, textures, and materials to build entirely
                        new environments. This page focuses purely on my 3D level design and environment art projects
                        for games, but all of my projects and art can be found on the <a href="/">main
                            portfolio page.</a> You can also click to see my <a

                        <p>Neon Pong is a 2D game I made in Java in 2019. The backgrounds for the game are maps built in
                            Team Fortress 2, acting as dioramas into the city the game is based in. Using TF2 assets let
                            me make the backgrounds very quickly, and I applied halftone filters to them so that they
                            would mesh well with the comic book style of the animation. Read more about

                    <p>
                        That Damn Goat is 4 player, chaotic party game developed at MAGIC Spell Studios at RIT, and is
                        planned to be released on the Nintendo Switch and PC. In the game, 4 players run around a 3D
                        space and try to grab a crown, and hold onto it for as long as possible. Players can be 1 of 12
                        different characters, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles, and there is an
                        omnipresent AI controlled goat that will knock players around, change the state of the game,
                        change which character a player is, etc. The game currently has 8 unique maps that are
                        randomly picked from, and the goal is to have enough maps so each one can be a character's
                        unique home area (such as a viking village map for the viking character).

                    <h3>Inspiration and Size</h3>
                    <p> When I joined the development team, there were no real level designs made for the project, so I
                        needed to experiment a lot to figure out what would work for the game. The maps needed to be
                        complex enough to be replayable, but also simple enough so new players at a party could jump
                        right in and enjoy. The project leads wanted unique levels that felt weird, as if they could not
                        have been from any other game. I decided to take inspiration from previous level designs I had
                        done which used oblique, organic angles for the geometry, rather than square, grid like
                        structures.
                    </p>

                    <p> The maps are designed almost like a circle, where players would naturally go around
                        the outer edge of the map to chase other players and look for items, and go in and out of the
                        center of the map to evade other players and grab the crown from its spawn point. This was
                        inspired by other tag-like games and circular maps
                        such as Royale Fumble from Fall Guys, Mario Chase from Nintendo Land, and Galaxy Burger from
                        Knockout City. I also kept the maps around the same size, 56x56 units in Unity, only going
                        larger or smaller if a specific map's design concept was to be that size. This 56x56 size was
                        decided
                        after playtesting many sizes, and it keeps players close together and almost constantly engaging
                        with each other.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p> The first map I designed, meant to be a partially indoor &quot;close quarters&quot; map, is not
                        designed for any specific character. This map features multiple layers, and feels like a
                        deathmatch level in Quake. We found that not only was the level too big horzizontally, but the
                        stacked layers made the level feel exponentially larger.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Designing for Flow</h3>
                    <p> Another big design concept used in these levels is the idea of flow. Basically, players should
                        never have to struggle through the maps, they should be able to hold forward on the
                        control stick, easily get to anywhere in the map, and not get stuck on any geometry. With the
                        players only having a control
                        stick on a gamepad to control the camera, it was also important that they wouldn't be required
                        to make any big rotations to face the right way. This was difficult to design around, as most of
                        my 3D level design experience is in games with first person camera controlled with a mouse,
                        which is much more precise input method for camera control. By designing for flow, however, I
                        could design the maps for maximum comfort and usability by players. The best map that
                        shows this is the Viking Village map, which has pathways that constantly loop to one another, so
                        the players were never going &quot;the wrong way.&quot; I also added invisible barriers to all
                        the maps, which
                        fade in when players get close, as falling off and getting put back on the map
                        constantly broke players' flow.
                    </p>

                            class="neon-pong-image">
                    </div>
                    <p>In these images of the Viking Village and Crusty Canyon maps, I marked the main walking pathways
                        with red, marked jump-pad arcs in blue/yellow, and outlined the overall circular shapes in
                        green dashed lines. The red paths constantly branch off and connect to one another, so players
                        always have options for where to go, and this doesn't even include the options players have with
                        height by jumping on and off ledges. In the Viking Village, there are 2 circular shapes formed
                        by the paths, with one circle smaller and inide the other. In the Crusty Canyon, the circles are
                        side by side, like a figure 8.</p>
                    <h3>Pipeline and Art</h3>
                    <p>The maps were all built using Probuilder in Unity. They were built as crude greyboxes, and the
                        specific features of each level were inspired by concept art and turned into gameplay spaces.
                        For example, I was given concept art of a desert with tall rock structures for the Crusty Canyon
                        map, which I then turned into a large, central rock with a hole in it, and I positioned
                        jump-pads that would launch players through the hole to the other side of the map. The greyboxes
                        were temporarily given textures from various asset packs. Our goal is to
                        get a vertical slice of the game done soon, which requires one map to be finished with final art
                        assets. We are art-passing the Viking Village map because it has the most finalized gameplay
                        design. After being given concept art of what each grey box
                        structure should look like with final art, I modeled parts of the map in
                        Blender. The goal is to get feedback from the leads, apply that feedback to the models, then
                        apply texture
                        maps given from the sculptors and 2D artists on the team onto the models by UVing them to fit.

                    <p>This is the quick, first translation of concept art to model. Specific pieces like the
                        dragon-looking decoration on the roof will be sculpted by team members in the future. This model
                        is still work in progress, so topology and optimization is not final.</p>

                    <p>
                        An artistic environment built using Blender and Unreal 5. In this project, I created trim sheets
                        and modular assets to build a lively city in Epic Games' Unreal 5 engine. The style for the city
                        was inspired by Velan Studio's game &quot;Knockout City&quot; (KO City) and its &quot;future
                        fifties&quot; aesthetic, as I call it. As the project
                        developed, I ended up turning the whole thing into a fan-art piece for KO City about a fanmade
                        part of the city known as The Devil's Cove, the name of which I based off of a
                        song in the KO City Soundtrack. It features the environment, my own lore for the environment,
                        and a fanmade message from the game's DJ narrator, which my friend Kieran Newell recorded an
                        impression of for the project. In this project I focused more on the artistic and narrative side
                        of an environment, rather than the gameplay design of a level.

                    <h3>Textures and Trim Sheets</h3>
                    <p> I started the project by grabbing tons of screenshots of The Hideout in KO City. KO City's
                        aesthetic features bright red bricks, and bold, warm lighting which reflects off of different
                        metalic, stone, and brick materials. I wanted to interpret this style into my project, so I
                        started by making a simple brick texture. I payed extra attention to the various shapes of the
                        bricks in game, as some of the bricks have oblique edges to give them a more cartoonish,
                        stylized look. I also made a trim sheet of various brick, concrete, and metal patterns.
                        Corresponding normal, roughness, and metalness maps were also made for these materials. These
                        texture maps were all hand drawn using Krita and its wrap around view mode so I could make the
                        textures tile correctly.

                    <h3>Modular Facades and Buildings</h3>
                    <p>Using Blender, I modeled different building assets such as facades, corners, and roofs. I UV'd
                        these to utilize the different textures I had made previously and I managed to get many
                        different uses out of a small range of textures. Each building asset was made with
                        interchangable
                        textures in mind, so two buildings could use the same models, but have different colors giving
                        them an entirely new look. I also applied a slight bevel to everything so the rims/edges of the
                        models reflected the sunlight in the map.

                    <h3>Making The Devil's Cove Feel Alive</h3>
                    <p>In a previous project, Future Fitness, I scripted a simple traffic system so cars, trucks,
                        predestrians, and monorail carts could drive along a set path, slow down and stop, and then
                        accelerate back up again. Along with the ambient sounds of vehicles and city life, it made the
                        entire city feel very alive. I felt this map needed a similar system, so using Unreal 5's
                        blueprints, I made a system that would move cars along a spline path. KO City actually does this
                        similarly in The Hideout, and it was a perfect way to tie the environment into KO City. I
                        modeled out some low poly fifties flying cars based on KO City's crew vehicles, made LODs for
                        them (along with all the other models in the map), and made the spline pathing system spawn the
                        cars in with randomly colored paint jobs.

                    <p>I also made various signs to decorate the buildings and blend the neon lit skyscrapers in with
                        the more traditional brick and concrete structures. These signs utilize a holographic scanline
                        material I created inspired by various hologram graphics in KO City. The most
                        important sign is the one for Headbang Hospital, but there is many different signs for fictional
                        businesses, and there is even a sign referencing my previous Future Fitness project. I also hung
                        up some flags on the buildings, and I used their world space position to randomize their texture
                        and used sine waves to animate them. All of these
                        neon lights, holograms, and animated objects really made the city pop with color and life, and
                        it all looks great using Unreal 5's Lumen lighting system.

                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>I have recieved very positive feedback on this project from my professor and from the KO City
                        community. With this project, I greatly improved my texturing, modeling, and lighting skills
                        from my previous projects. The simple, modular assets I made were given lots of detail with my
                        handpainted textures, and the warm lighting and animated assets made everything pop with color.
                        I look forward to doing more projects in the future with bright, bold environments like this
                        one.</p>

                    <h2>Cursed Cove</h2>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">Professional, April - October 2018</h3>
                    <p>In a team of 12, I helped developed the map "Cursed Cove" for Valve Software's "Team Fortress 2".
                        The map was bought and featured by Valve as a part of the Halloween "Scream Fortress" event in
                        2018. On the team, I contributed concepts for the level design, and I developed parts of the
                        background/skybox of the map. In the map, players must kill other players to collect their
                        souls, and then must deliver those souls to Davy Jones' Locker.</p>

                <div class="modal-desc">
                    <h3>Design Concepts</h3>
                    <p>During pre-production of the map, I contributed ideas for
                        possible building shapes, locations on the map, and gameplay concepts. In order to create the
                        feeling of a &quot;bustling pirate bay&quot; our buildings were made very tall with lots of
                        cramped, narrow alleyways in between.</p>

                    <h3>Background and Skybox Detailing</h3>
                    <p>When the playable area of the map was nearly complete, some teammates and I started working on
                        the out-of-bounds areas. While the playable area was symmetrical between the two teams, RED and
                        BLU, the out-of-bounds areas would be asymmetrical to appear more visually interesting. I helped
                        develop the jungle/forest area behind RED's base, as well as the cobble fortress behind BLU's
                        base. This perfectly blended Team Fortress 2's tropes of RED using lots of natural, wooden
                        materials, and BLU
                        using lots of industrial materials for their bases with an old-timey pirate theme. While much of
                        BLU's fortress was scrapped in the final product due to optimization concerns, it still helped
                        us understand the visual style were we aiming for.</p>

                        An artistic environment/level design built using Maya and Unity. This project features all of
                        the steps in creating and environment, from the initial greybox to the final build. This project
                        features over 100 unique models and materials, all created by me. This was the first time I had
                        used Unity's material and lighting system, but my knowledge of the Source Engine gave me a good
                        foundation to start learning from. This was a solo project.

                    <h3>Greybox</h3>
                    <p>I used primitives in Unity to develop the greybox for the environment. This gave me a good sense
                        of where all my objects should be in the environment, as well as what objects I will need and
                        how big they will be. I also scripted a traffic system so that the game automatically fills the
                        city with trucks, cars, vans, buses, pedestrians, and monorail carts and moves them along paths
                        to give the city some life.

                    <h3>Details and Modular Design</h3>
                    <p>I then created models inside Maya that had more detail. Once these were built and UVed, I
                        imported them into Unity and replaced the primitves with the more detailed models. For the city
                        scape, I created different building &quot;facade&quot; models, and used them to construct
                        different types of buildings. This modular design made all of the buildings fit the same visual
                        style, and made it so I did not have to create tons of large, unique building models each with
                        their own details.

                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>I then created textures and materials for all of the objects, this was my first time creating my
                        own normal maps and messing with the metallic properties of materials. Finally, I built
                        reflection probes, baked
                        lighting, created my own skybox texture, added ambience sound effects (I used sounds from Team
                        Fortress 2), and added
                        some post processing effects to make the city's colors pop!</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Personal, February - April 2018</h3>
                    <p>A Team Fortress 2 map that makes players fight against my own 1930's style animated characters,
                        play minigames for power-ups, and take control of the center control point, all released on
                        April Fools as a
                        &quot;joke styled map&quot;. I was
                        inspired by Studio MDHR's 2017 game, &quot;Cuphead&quot;, with its own 1930's aesthetics and
                        jazz
                        soundtrack. This was the first time I had done a large scale project based on hand-drawn
                        animation. This project was done solo.</p>

                    <p><img src="media/queen-banner.png" loading="lazy" alt="Queen Elizabeth logo and character"
                            class="queen-banner">
                    </p>

                    <h3>A New, Old-Timey, Concept</h3>
                    <p> No one had really done a map with hand-drawn animated
                        characters before, at least not to the same scope that I was going to attempt, meaning I was on
                        my own to figure out how it should work. With hard limits on how much I could push the Source
                        Engine to my will, I brainstormed many ideas
                        on how to accomplish my goal. I thought of using 3D models with animated textures, but that was
                        beyond my skillset at the time. I also thought of having tons of brushes, each one with
                        a single frame of animation textured on it, that would flicker on and off in a sequence, but
                        that would be wildly inefficient. I finally decided to utilize particle systems, as they are
                        literally meant for putting 2D sprites in a 3D environment, and they gave me a huge range of
                        customizability.
                    </p>

                    <p>The first test had some flickering issues, so to fix
                        this I just duplicated the animation. Overall, using the particle system was a very cheap and
                        easy way to display the animations in the map, and it also meant I could make the character
                        always face the player's viewpoint, making the character look very evil.</p>

                    </video>

                    <p>After that first in-game test, I saw the potential of the idea, and I knew I had something
                        special.</p>
                    <h3>The Hand-Drawn Process</h3>
                    <p>The design of the queen is based on many actual queens in history, such as <a
                            href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/404444/elizabeth-i-when-a-princess"

                            Scrotts' painting of Elizabeth I</a>, a

                            Queen Victoria</a>, and
                        <a href="https://www.purecostumes.com/FM58372/queen-elizabeth-adult-costume.html"
                            target="_blank">various Halloween costumes of queens</a> I found on Google. I was a
                        big fan of the warm tones used in the clothing, and decided to give her a red and gold color
                        palette. Her actual visual design is loosely based off of how I would think Americans in the
                        1930's would picture an evil English queen, but modernized a bit to fit today's standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to properly animate the queen, I bought a cheap light pad, some tracing paper, and I got
                        to work. My process was to pencil draw each frame (&quot;pencil test&quot;), scan frames to
                        digital images with a
                        printer/scanner, insert the images into a video, look for issues in the animation, make any
                        adjustments needed, and repeat until the
                        movement was where I wanted it. I then trace over each frame on another sheet with .3 mm and
                        .1mm PITT Artist Pens (&quot;inking&quot;), scan each frame again, and then color digitally
                        with Paint.NET.</p>

                    <p>In total, the animation clocked in at about 80-90 frames, with there being about 160 drawings, as
                        each frame had both a pencil and inked version. It was a long process that took about a month,
                        but
                        the final result was such a
                        good imitation of the 1930's style. Many people who played the map did not realize that it was
                        original animation with an original character. Some even thought that I ripped the
                        animation straight from &quot;Cuphead&quot;, which in my opinion means I did a pretty good job.

                    <h3>That's Not All, Folks</h3>
                    <p>As a map developed for an April Fools celebration, it has plenty more to offer than just the boss
                        fight. The map is filled to the brim with minigames, jokes, references, and all sorts of fun
                        little
                        knick knacks. While the boss fight was the main focus, these smaller
                        moments are what support the map, and they made sure the in game voice chat was filled with
                        bursts of laughter.

                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>On April 10th, 2018 I woke up to a surprise message from popular
                        YouTuber, <a href="https://twitter.com/RTGameCrowd" target="_blank">RTGame Daniel</a>, saying he
                        was releasing a video about my map. Since then, RTGame Daniel has amassed an enormous following
                        on YouTube and Twitch, and the small success of my map has
                        encouraged me to keep going until I stumble upon my next great idea. I am very appreciative of
                        RTGame, his community, and the opportunities they opened up for me. You can watch his video,
                        which shows the map in good detail, below.

                    <p>Queen Elizabeth III was the first time I had done a large scale project based on hand-drawn
                        animation, and those techniques and skills can be seen influencing my future projects
                        such as Neon Pong and Scarlet Meadow.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Academic/Personal, April - May 2019</h3>
                    <p>A side-scrolling, singleplayer game where you return attacks from a "Pong" based enemy in urban
                        environments. I developed the game with a partner using Java and its built-in libraries.
                        The game features traditional, hand-drawn animation and a bold comic book style made by me. Neon
                        Pong had a very quick development cycle and some technical hurdles, which affected all aspects
                        of the project.
                    </p>

                <div class="modal-desc">
                    <h3>A Dynamic Take on an Old Classic</h3>
                    <p>In Neon Pong, your goal is to win a Pong game, but this time you control a physical character
                        rather than a simple bar/paddle. Everytime you hit the ball, its speed increases and you built
                        up a special meter. The game required physics, precise movement, and fast graphics.
                        My partner and I started by developing a simple update-render cycle that
                        took advantage of multiple threads to display graphics. The game needed to run at a frame rate
                        of at least 30-60 frames per second, and it needed to do this on the school computers. Due to
                        this, the game's resolution is locked at 720p, and it limits how many images we can render at
                        once.
                    </p>

                    <p>I then developed the physics and collisions systems, which were not as optimized as they could
                        have been,
                        as the collisions used a lot of &quot;pixel perfect&quot; calculations for basic rectangle
                        hitboxes. Of course, after the fact we realize we should have used the more efficient
                        Axis-Aligned Bounding Box collisions, which I do use in later projects. I also developed an
                        external &quot;Animation
                        Viewer&quot; tool in Java that lets me add images to an animation as frames, customize their
                        order, and dynamically adjust the speed of the animations. This let me quickly scan pencil tests
                        and immediately load them into the tool to find and
                        fix any janky movement. It also allowed me to fine-tune the speed of the animation so they could
                        go directly into the game.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-Drawn Animation with Comic Book Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>With this game's very quick development cycle, I had to cut some corners on the animation. The
                        longest hand-drawn animations were the run
                        cycles, clocking in at only 6 frames each (not including the electric-shock effect, which is 20
                        frames but was done digitally). All other animations were just 1 frame poses. This made all
                        of the movement feel very snappy, but that actually meshed really well with the fast, precise
                        gameplay. I also applied a
                        halftone filter to everything, which was a really cheap and effective method to add some much
                        needed texture to otherwise flat drawings, and it made everything look like it came straight
                        from a comic book.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Detailed Backgrounds in a 2D Scene</h3>
                    <p>While the animation was hand-drawn, I did not have time to draw or paint backgrounds, so I made
                        them by creating maps in Team Fortress 2. These were dioramas of sorts that were only seen from
                        one angle, and they were originally split up into layers for a parallax scrolling effect, but
                        this got cut due to optimization concerns. Using TF2 as a base let me quickly add lighting and
                        use premade assets, which gave the background detail in a very short timespan. I also
                        applied halftone filters here so they were mesh well with the animation.

                    </p>
                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>Compared to my other projects, Neon Pong is definitely smaller content wise. But being one of the
                        first games that I built entirely from scratch, having such a small development cycle, and being
                        one of the last major projects I did during my senior year of high school, it holds a special
                        place in my heart. Our teacher gave us an immediate 100&#37; on the graphics, but docked us a
                        couple
                        points on the game, as it was a little too fast and difficult for her. The characters of Neon
                        Pong, Electra and Suit, will return as part of a much larger ensemble of characters in Neon
                        Heights.</p>
