                    <h4>Feb 2020 - May 2020</h4>
                    <p>A 2D platformer, beat-em-up game with traditional, hand-drawn animation,
                        developed in C# and Monogame. I worked with a team as the lead artist, developed a
                        physics system for objects in the game, and designed and developed a robust, graphical level
                        editor using C# and Monogame for content production for the game. The game features traditional,
                        hand-drawn animation with inspiration from comic books and Cuban architecture.</p>

                    <h3>Cursed Cove</h3>
                    <h4>Apr 2018 - Oct 2018</h4>
                    <p>In a team of 12, I helped developed the map "Cursed Cove" for Valve Software's "Team Fortress 2".
                        The map was <strong>bought and featured by Valve</strong> as a part of the Halloween "Scream Fortress"
                        event in 2018. On the team, I helped bring up concepts for the level design, and I developed
                        parts of the background/skybox of the map.</p>

                        inspired by 1930's cartoons. The map also features many other gimmicks including minigames,

                    <p>A side-scrolling, singleplayer game where you return attacks from a "Pong"
                        invasion in urban environments. The game was developed using Java, utilizing built-in Java
                        libraries, and it features traditional, hand-drawn animation and a bold comic book style. "Neon
                        Pong" stars two characters, Electra and Suit, from "Neon Heights" (see Ongoing Projects).</p>

                    <h4>Feb 2019 - Current</h4>
                    <p>A local and online multiplayer game currently being developed in Unity. Two teams of four players
                        pick between eight different unique characters to play in this intense Team Hand Ball inspired
                        sport, but with more platforming, fighting, and teamwork. Teams will face off in sprawling,
                        urban environments such as neon-lit rooftops and overgrown underpasses. Prototypes of the game
                        were developed with character and level designs, however an updated, online version of the game
                        is still in development.</p>
