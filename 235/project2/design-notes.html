        <div id="design-notes">I'm really happy with the look of the site. Its smooth and easy to understand.
            Overall, the 2 hardest things were favoriting GIFs, and implementing filters with searching.
            <br><br>
            With favoriting gifs, it was really difficult to make the button of the gif fill in/be hollow
            in ALL instances of that gif, no matter if it was in the trending, search, or favorites section.
            It had to be consistent, and that took a lot of storing HTML elements and searching through arrays to figure
            out.
            Debug tools and the console log really helped me out here.
            <br><br>
            With filters (specifically the recency filter), it is possible to make the results you see on screen
            different from the results that Giphy
            gives me. What I mean by this is that Giphy will give me 25 gifs, and I need to wittle those down into what
            fits the filter. But what if that
            one query of 25 gifs resulted in 0 that fit the filter? Is the search really done? Did I search giphy for
            gifs that
            fit the filter? Or did I just search THOSE 25 gifs for ones that fit the filter. So I had to query Giphy
            until it returns with no results, or I have enough
            gifs to fill up the page, and then if the user wants to search even more of giphy, they can click the 'load
            more' button.
            It took a while to figure out the order of conditional statements to do this process, but overall I'm very
            proud of it.
            <br><br>
            I'm also really happy with the feedback messages that appear when the user copies a link or
            favorites/unfavorites a gif.
            <br><br>
            I'd give myself a very good grade, I don't know maybe an A, because my site is smooth, easy to use, and its
            honestly kind of fun to just easily
            favorite gifs to store for later. I could see the practical use of searching for gifs, saving reaction gifs
            the user likes, and then later on,
            when they need to quickly get that reaction gif to respond to a chat message, they can access their
            favorites just like that.
